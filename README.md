## Overview

Welcome to PHPCraft 2D, the game where Minecraft meets PHP. I mean, who hasn't dreamed of that combination, right? Explore a 2D world, change blocks, and marvel at the pulsating pixel that represents you. All powered by the magical world of PHP and HTML!

## Features

- A 2D world rendered in a table grid. Ah, the nostalgia!
- Move around with arrow keys. No fancy controllers required.
- Place blocks like grass, water, stone, and dirt. You're basically a god.
- Your position and block selection are stored in sessions. So, forget about saving. We've got you!
- Pulsating pixel to indicate your position. It's like you're alive, but in a browser.

## Requirements

- PHP (obviously)
- A Web Server like Apache or Nginx
- A sense of humor (optional but highly recommended)
  
## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Copy all files to your web server directory.
3. Open your browser and navigate to the server's address.
4. Enjoy your existential crisis in a 2D PHP world.

## How to Play

### Moving

- Press arrow keys to move.
  - Left Arrow: Move left
  - Right Arrow: Move right
  - Up Arrow: Move up
  - Down Arrow: Move down

### Placing Blocks

- Use the form buttons to select a block type:
  - None: Ah, the Zen choice. Do nothing.
  - Grass: Like Astroturf, but cheaper.
  - Water: For those who like to live on the edge.
  - Stone: The cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast.
  - Dirt: It's... dirt. What more do you want?

Your selection will be displayed above the world grid.

### World Around You

- The world around you is displayed in a table grid.
- You are represented by a pulsating pixel. Yes, you're that important.

## Troubleshooting

- **The world won't render**: Are you sure you're in the right dimension?
- **Can't move**: Did you try turning it off and on again?
- **I don't like this game**: Well, you can always go back to Minesweeper.
